# My CSS Battle Solutions
## Why?
Because [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/) only allows it's users to view their last 5 solutions, unless they pay money. So I decided to just make a place to keep all my solutions forever and always so I dont have to pay to see them. Shame on you, [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/).

I dont plan on hosting this anywhere anytime soon, so if you wanna see it in action, clone it and run it locally.

Non-descriptive class names because the cssbattle.dev score is based on character count.
